# Development Workflow<a name="development-workflow"></a>

You start development by configuring and downloading a package from the Amazon FreeRTOS console in the AWS IoT console\. You unzip the package and import it into your IDE\. You can then develop your embedded application on your selected hardware platform and manufacture and deploy these devices using the development process appropriate for your device\. Deployed devices can connect to the AWS IoT service or AWS IoT Greengrass as part of a complete IoT solution\. The following diagram shows the development workflow and the subsequent connectivity from Amazon FreeRTOS\-based devices\.
