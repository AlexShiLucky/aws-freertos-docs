## Registering Your MCU Board with AWS IoT<a name="get-started-freertos-thing"></a>

 You must register your MCU board so it can communicate with AWS IoT\. To register your device, you must create:
+ An AWS IoT policy\. 

  The AWS IoT policy grants your device permissions to access AWS IoT resources\.
+ An IoT thing\.

  An IoT thing allows you to manage your devices in AWS IoT\. 
+ A private key and X\.509 certificate\.

  The private key and certificate allow your device to authenticate with AWS IoT\.

**To create an AWS IoT policy**

1. To create an IAM policy, you need to know your AWS Region and AWS account number\. 

   To find your AWS account number, in the upper\-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose **My Account**\. Your account ID is displayed under **Account Settings**\.

   To find the AWS Region for your AWS account, open a command prompt window and enter the following command:

   ```
   AWS IoT describe-endpoint
   ```

   The output should look like this:

   ```
   {
       "endpointAddress": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
   }
   ```

   In this example, the region is `us-west-2`\.

1. Browse to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Secure**, choose **Policies**, and then choose **Create**\.

1. Enter a name to identify your policy\.

1. In the **Add statements** section, choose **Advanced mode**\. Copy and paste the following JSON into the policy editor window\. Replace *aws\-region* and *aws\-account* with your region and account ID \.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "iot:Connect",
           "Resource":"arn:aws:iot:<aws-region>:<aws-account-id>:*"
   	}, 
       {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "iot:Publish",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:<aws-region>:<aws-account-id>:*"
       },
       {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:<aws-region>>:<aws-account-id>:*"
       },
       {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iot:Receive",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:<aws-region>:<aws-account-id>:*"
       }
       ]
   }
   ```

   This policy grants the following permissions:  
`iot:Connect`  
Grants your device the permission to connect to the AWS IoT message broker\.  
`iot:Publish`  
Grants your device the permission to publish an MQTT message on the `freertos/demos/echo` MQTT topic\.  
`iot:Subscribe`  
Grants your device the permission to subscribe to the `freertos/demos/echo` MQTT topic filter\.  
`iot:Receive`  
Grants your device the permission to receive messages from the AWS IoT message broker\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

**To create an IoT thing, private key, and certificate for your device**

1. Browse to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Manage**, and then choose **Things**\.

1. If you do not have any IoT things registered in your account, the **You don't have any things yet** page is displayed\. If you see this page, choose **Register a thing**\. Otherwise, choose **Create**\.

1. On the **Creating AWS IoT things** page, choose **Create a single thing**\.

1. On the **Add your device to the thing registry** page, enter a name for your thing, and then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Add a certificate for your thing** page, under **One\-click certificate creation**, choose **Create certificate**\.

1. Download your private key and certificate by choosing the **Download** links for each\. Make a note of the certificate ID\. You need it later to attach a policy to your certificate\.

1. Choose **Activate** to activate your certificate\. Certificates must be activated prior to use\.

1. Choose **Attach a policy** to attach a policy to your certificate that grants your device access to AWS IoT operations\.

1. Choose the policy you just created and choose **Register thing**\.

## Installing a Terminal Emulator<a name="uart-term"></a>

A terminal emulator can help you diagnose problems or verify that your device code is running properly\. There are a variety of terminal emulators available for Windows, macOS, and Linux\.

You must connect your board to your computer before you attempt to establish a serial connection to your board with a terminal emulator\.

Use the following settings to configure your terminal emulator:


| Terminal Setting | Value | 
| --- | --- | 
|  BAUD rate  |  115200  | 
|  Data  |  8 bit  | 
|  Parity  |  none  | 
|  Stop  |  1 bit  | 
|  Flow control  |  none  | 

If you do not know your board's serial port, you can issue one of the following commands from the command line or terminal to return the serial ports for all devices connected to your host computer:

Windows  

```
chgport
```

Linux  

```
ls /dev/tty*
```

macOS  

```
ls /dev/cu.*
```
